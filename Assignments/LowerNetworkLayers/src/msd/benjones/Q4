Implement the onInit and onDistanceMessage methods in the Router class of the following code:

Implement the method so that the routers use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute routing information. Use the static
methods in the Network class to help you with this. These methods shouldn't be more than 20 lines of code or so!

Once you have a working implementation, test your algorithm on a variety of network sizes. Plot the number of messages
required to converge as a function of network size. Since the networks are probablisitically generated, you might want
to try several networks of each size to get a sense of the distribution.

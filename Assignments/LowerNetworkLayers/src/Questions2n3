------------------------------------------QUESTION 2: Throttling------------------------------------------
    QUESTION:
What is the difference between flow control and congestion control? Describe the way TCP implements each of these features.

    ANSWER:
Both flow control and congestion control are methods to keep data flowing smoothly between sending and receiving nodes by limiting the data stream.
The main difference is that flow control puts limitation on the rate of data that the sender can transmit, while congestion control limits
the flow of data that the receiver can take in.

The TCP implements flow control by having each ACK that the receiver gives to the sender contain a cue for how many bytes the receiver can stand to receive.

The TCP implements congestion control by having the sender provide the receiver with a slightly increasing number of packets until the point that the
packet is dropped, after which the sender responds by defaulting back to the base number of packets. It'll then begin slowly increasing the rate again,
until the same thing occurs, again and again.


------------------------------------------QUESTION 3: Routers------------------------------------------

    QUESTION:
A company has 3 groups that each hava a subnet on the corporate network. Group A uses subnet 1.1.1.0/24. Group B uses 1.1.2.0/24. Group C uses subnet
1.1.3.0/24.

Each group has a router. There is a link between each pair of routers. A and B have a link: 1.1.4.0 (on A) to 1.1.4.1 (on B) A and C have a link: 1.1.5.0
(on A) to 1.1.5.1 (on C) B and C have a link: 1.1.6.0 (on B) to 1.1.6.1 (on C).

What subnet prefix (the smallest
 one) describes the entire collection of addresses, including the routers as identified in the network where they are
linked?

    ANSWER:
1.1.0.0/16

    QUESTION:
Assume the router for group A has 4 ports: port 1 is connected to the group subnet, port 2 is connected to router B, port 3 is connected to router C, and
port 4 is connected to the ISP (i.e., the rest of the internet). Write out router A's forwarding table.

    ANSWER:
Dest                    Hop                         Port
1.1.1.0/24          Direct                           1
1.1.2.0/24          via 1.1.4.1                      2
1.1.3.0/24          via 1.1.5.1                      3
1.1.4.0/24          Direct                           2
1.1.5.0/24          Direct                           3
1.1.6.0/24          via 1.1.4.1 or 1.1.5.1          2 or 3
0.0.0.0/24          via ISP                          4
